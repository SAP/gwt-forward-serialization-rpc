 * compression to the point where the content written to it exceeds the buffer size or the stream is
 * {@link #flush() flushed} or {@link #close() closed}. If the stream is {@link #close() closed}
 * before the buffer size is exceeded, the buffer is written to the {@link HttpServletResponse}'s
 * {@link HttpServletResponse#getOutputStream() output stream} without compression activated. If the
 * stream is {@link #flush() flushed} before compression was activated, the buffer content is
 * flushed to the response's output stream, the buffer is released, and compression will not be
 * activated for this stream ever. {@link #flush() Flushing} the stream after compression has been
 * activated will delegate to the {@link GZIPOutputStream}'s {@link GZIPOutputStream#flush() flush}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The stream is not thread-safe. Multiple threads trying to write to it concurrently may end up in
 * a race condition, may overwrite buffer content and may cause inconsistencies when crossing the
